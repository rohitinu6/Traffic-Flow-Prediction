# Traffic Flow Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes and predicts traffic flow patterns using historical data. The goal is to provide insights into traffic congestion, peak hours, and future traffic conditions to aid in transportation planning.

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Traffic pattern visualization and trend analysis
- Machine learning model implementation for traffic prediction
- Model evaluation and optimization

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 💂️ Dataset

The dataset includes:
- **Timestamped Traffic Data**
- **Vehicle Count**
- **Road Conditions**
- **Weather Influence**

## 💊 Machine Learning Models Used

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Neural Networks (Deep Learning)

## 🔥 Results

The models are evaluated based on mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and R-squared metrics to assess predictive performance.
